# Research Codebase

You are tasked with conducting comprehensive research across the codebase to answer user questions by spawning tasks and synthesizing their findings.

The user will provide a ticket for you to read and begin researching.

## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:

1. **Read the ticket first:**
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files
   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks
   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research

2. **Detail the steps needed to perform the research:**
    - Break down the user's ticket into composable research areas
    - Take time to think about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural the ticket has provided
    - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate
    - Lay out what the codebase-locator or thoughts-locator should look for
    - Specify what patterns the codebase-pattern-finder should look for
    - Be clear that locators and pattern-finders collect information for analyzers
    - Typically run a single codebase-analyzer and thoughts-analyzer (in parallel if both needed)
    - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant

3. **Spawn tasks for comprehensive research (follow this sequence):**
   
   **Phase 1 - Locate (Codebase & Thoughts):**
   - Identify all topics/components/areas you need to locate
   - Group related topics into coherent batches
   - Spawn **codebase-locator** agents in parallel for each topic group to find WHERE files and components live
   - Simultaneously spawn **thoughts-locator** agents in parallel to discover relevant documents
   - **WAIT** for all locator agents to complete before proceeding

   **Phase 2 - Find Patterns (Codebase only):**
   - Based on locator results, identify patterns you need to find
   - Use **codebase-pattern-finder** agents to find examples of similar implementations
   - Run multiple pattern-finders in parallel if searching for different unique patterns
   - **WAIT** for all pattern-finder agents to complete before proceeding

   **Phase 3 - Analyze (Codebase & Thoughts):**
   - Using information from locators and pattern-finders, determine what needs deep analysis
   - Group analysis tasks by topic/component
   - Spawn **codebase-analyzer** agents in parallel for each topic group to understand HOW specific code works
   - Spawn **thoughts-analyzer** agents in parallel to extract key insights from the most relevant documents found
   - **WAIT** for all analyzer agents to complete before proceeding

   **Phase 4 - Platform Expert Analysis (Optional - when cross-platform concerns exist):**
   - Based on ticket and code analysis, determine if changes affect Android, iOS, or WASM builds
   - **When to use**:
     - Changes involve file I/O, networking, threading, or system calls
     - Native code or platform-specific APIs are involved
     - Build system changes may affect cross-compilation
     - Performance or size constraints are platform-specific
   - Spawn platform expert agents in parallel (all that apply):
     - **android-expert**: For Android compatibility and build analysis
     - **ios-expert**: For iOS compatibility and build analysis
     - **wasm-expert**: For WebAssembly/browser compatibility analysis
   - **WAIT** for all platform expert agents to complete before synthesizing

   **Important sequencing notes:**
   - Each phase builds on the previous one - locators inform pattern-finding, both inform analysis, all inform platform analysis
   - Run agents of the same type in parallel within each phase
   - Never mix agent types in parallel execution
   - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for
   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know
   - Platform experts are optional - only use when cross-platform concerns exist

4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**
   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding
   - Compile all sub-agent results (codebase, thoughts, and platform expert findings)
   - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth
   - Use thoughts/ findings as supplementary historical context
   - Integrate platform expert analysis for cross-compilation impacts
   - Connect findings across different components
   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference
   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions
   - Document platform-specific constraints and requirements
   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence

5. **Gather metadata for the research document:**

Use the following metadata for the research document frontmatter:

**metadata for frontmatter**

!`agentic metadata`

6. **Generate research document:**
   - Filename: `thoughts/research/date_topic.md`
   - Use the metadata gathered in step 5, mapping XML tags to frontmatter fields
   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:
     ```markdown
     ---
     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]
     git_commit: [from metadata]
     branch: [from metadata]
     repository: [from metadata]
     topic: "[User's Question/Topic]"
     tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]
     last_updated: [from metadata]

## Important notes:
- Follow the three-phase sequence: Locate → Find Patterns → Analyze
- Use parallel Task agents OF THE SAME TYPE ONLY within each phase to maximize efficiency and minimize context usage
- Always run fresh codebase research - never rely solely on existing research documents
- The thoughts/architecture directory contains important information about the codebase details
- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference
- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context
- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused on read-only operations
- Consider cross-component connections and architectural patterns
- Include temporal context (when the research was conducted)
- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis, not deep file reading
- Encourage sub-agents to find examples and usage patterns, not just definitions
- Explore all of thoughts/ directory, not just research subdirectory
- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks
- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly
  - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before spawning sub-tasks (step 1)
  - ALWAYS wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing (step 4)
  - ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document (step 5 before step 6)
  - NEVER write the research document with placeholder values
- **Frontmatter consistency**:
  - Always include frontmatter at the beginning of research documents
  - Keep frontmatter fields consistent across all research documents
  - Update frontmatter when adding follow-up research
  - Use snake_case for multi-word field names (e.g., `last_updated`, `git_commit`)
  - Tags should be relevant to the research topic and components studied
